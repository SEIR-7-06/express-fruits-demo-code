REST (Representational State Transfer)
- A convention that programmers use to organize where 
their data can be found and how it can be interacted with.

- There are 7 RESTful routes


MVC (Model, View, Controller)
- An architectural paradigm, where we separate functionalities
of our app into different sections.  
- Having a place for each "concern"
- aka "Separation of Concerns"

- Model: Our data - describe the shape of our data
- View: How The User sees that data (aka how its represented)
- Controller: Organizes where the user goes to access our data

### Views:
    - .ejs files
        - it LOOKS like HTML, but it's JS
        - a "template"
        - will be used to "render" a real .html file
        that we send to the user.
